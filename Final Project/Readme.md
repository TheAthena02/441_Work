### Final Project
Here we are, the final project. For this project I wanted to recreate a project I made with my brother. This is an Attribute Chart Generator. Last time I did this project, I did the visual component last time, while my brother did the html and javascript of reading the inputs. The visuals were also in p5js. This time, I did almost everything. The only thing my brother helped me with was figuring out the equations for drawing the lines. this was a collaborative effort, where he game me the equation in a lambda function as he would write it in python, and I adapted it to javascript. I had to edit it quite a bit, and it looks very different, but the math itself is from his mind. This time, the visuals are in HTML5 canvas, which functions similar to p5js, but with a few differences. Then, I did all the communication between the inputs and the output with jQuery and jQueryUI. The sliders are jQueryUI, which operate similar to traditional sliders, but look a little nicer and I believe operate a little better with jQuery. Im very happy with how this turned out and it felt nice to be able to do this myself this time.
