# Reflection
While ChatGPT did do everything correct, it missed quite a bit as well. For starters, it did not ask me what to put in each field, but instead filled them on its own with simple descriptions. The hardest part to me was figuring out which sites and games to put down, so this did not resolve some of the homework. It also added random things that didnt fill the requirements, especially comments. However, doing so reminded me to add comments to my own code, which was useful. I may in the future use this to help me find something I didn't think of doing, or help me catch a requirement I missed.
