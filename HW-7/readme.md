### Homework 7
This homework, I really was able to get into the coding of things. Ive worked with classes before, so this was somewhat review. Everything felt solid and familiar. The only thing I really struggled with was making it so that each button click would make a new image appear. Any issues I had were simple issues and were fixed rather quickly.
