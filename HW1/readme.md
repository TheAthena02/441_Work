# Week 1
With this week, I found that I did not remember as much as I had hoped. I had to look up a lot of what I did this week, but things did start to come back to me by the time I was onto my style sheet. I had some frustration with my initial layout-- getting the parallaxing to work, the image to fit the screen right, and my page menu to look right was a struggle. Here is an example of a few of the issues i was having:

My menu still looks a little strange on some page sizes. Im also finding that working on my 2k monitor isnt the best move, as most people wont look at the page at this size.
