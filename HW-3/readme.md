# My Thoughts
This assignment was way more work than I expected. The act of writing a choose your own adventure story is a massive amount of work. The act of creating the system wasn't too hard, after remembering that switches existed and how to use them. There may have been an easier way to handle the buttons, but I needed their text and output to be different each time, so putting them in each function as part of the string made the most sense. It is very tedious though, which is why my story is shorter than requested. I just don't have the time tonight to write 15 pages of simple story tonight. I will give more time for next week's assignment so i have time to build this up.
